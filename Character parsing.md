Vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']

if it's a number just write the number.
if the character is solo just change it to the number of the character.
if the character is not solo, add the character to a variable, check if the next character is vowel or not.
if the next character is a vowel add it to the same variable.
if not then turn the character inside the variable to a number and move on to the next character.
